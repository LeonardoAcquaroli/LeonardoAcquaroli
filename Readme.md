# Hi! I'm Leonardo, and this is me in bullet points:

- 🍝 As Steve Jobs suggested, I'm a hungry guy, in fact my favorite hobby is eating.
- 💻 I love playing around with data, mostly building predictive statistical models.
- ⚽ I play football since I was 6.
- 🧠 I co-founded UnimAI, the student group to share knowledge, experiences and make connections in the world of Data science.
- 💸 I curated several Financial Education events and developed "B come Bill" a startup to bring financial education into schools through gamification.
- 📖 I take courses, read books and all those things we brag about.
- 🏫 Oh I almost forgot, I have a bachelor in Economics and a master's degree in Data science for Economics.
